# Lowerto: Interactive Embedded Systems Learning Platform

## Mission
Lowerto is a quarto (.qmd) inspired embedded systems education file format and renderer with an interactive document framework. We're building a browser-based environment for writing, executing, and sharing low-level programming and embedded systems content, making complex technical topics accessible and engaging.

## Architecture Overview

### Frontend (React)
- Rendering interactive documents
- Code editor with real-time execution
- WebAssembly runtime for C/C++
- Embedded systems visualization components

### Backend (Python Flask)
- Document parsing and compilation
- API for content management
- WebAssembly module generation

### Document Format
- Markdown-based with YAML frontmatter
- Custom extensions for embedded systems features

### Storage
- Document database (MongoDB)
- User data management

## Embedded Systems Features
- Virtual hardware simulation
- Sandboxed code execution
- RTOS and communication protocol visualizations
- Interactive debugging tools

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (3 months)
To lay the groundwork, we're focusing on:
- [ ] Implementing basic document structure and parsing
- [ ] Developing Markdown rendering with code highlighting
- [ ] Creating a WebAssembly-based C/C++ execution environment
- [ ] Setting up React frontend and Flask backend

### Phase 2: Core Features (3 months)
Building on our foundation, we'll be:
- [ ] Implementing an interactive code editor
- [ ] Developing virtual hardware simulation
- [ ] Creating memory and I/O visualization components
- [ ] Setting up user authentication and document saving

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (3 months)
To enhance the learning experience, we're aiming to:
- [ ] Develop RTOS visualization and simulation
- [ ] Implement communication protocol animators
- [ ] Create advanced virtual hardware debugging tools
- [ ] Develop an automated exercise checking system

### Phase 4: Polish and Optimization (3 months)
Preparing for launch, we'll be:
- [ ] Optimizing WebAssembly execution and compilation
- [ ] Refining UI/UX based on user feedback
- [ ] Implementing collaborative editing features
- [ ] Developing comprehensive documentation

### Phase 5: Launch and Expansion (3 months)
To successfully launch, we need to:
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing and bug fixing
- [ ] Develop sample content across various topics
- [ ] Implement usage analytics
- [ ] Execute marketing campaign and official release
